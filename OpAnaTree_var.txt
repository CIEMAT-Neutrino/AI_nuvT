### Event and Identification Variables:
- **`eventID`**: The unique identifier for a particular event (interaction or triggered readout) in the detector.
- **`runID`**: Identifier for the run during which the event was recorded. A run is a specific period during which the detector collects data.
- **`subrunID`**: A further subdivision of a run, useful for managing large data sets or specific calibration periods within a run.

### Neutrino Interaction Variables:
- **`nuvX`, `nuvY`, `nuvZ`, `nuvT`**: The position (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) and time (`T`) of the neutrino interaction vertex. This is where the neutrino is believed to have interacted with the argon nucleus.
- **`nuvE`**: The energy of the incoming neutrino at the interaction vertex.

### Particle Track and Energy Deposition Variables:
- **`stepX`, `stepY`, `stepZ`, `stepT`**: The position and time for each step of a particle’s track through the detector, likely as it deposits energy in the LArTPC.
- **`dE`**: The energy deposited in a single step, potentially along a track in the detector.
- **`energydep`, `energydepX`, `energydepY`, `energydepZ`**: The total energy deposited and the components of energy deposition in the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` directions.
- **`E`**: The total energy of a particle, possibly after summing up all energy depositions or the total energy of a particle at a specific point.

### Momentum Variables:
- **`StartPx`, `StartPy`, `StartPz`**: The momentum components of a particle at the start of its trajectory in the detector.
- **`EndPx`, `EndPy`, `EndPz`**: The momentum components of a particle at the end of its trajectory.

### Process and Particle Identification:
- **`process`**: Describes the type of interaction or physical process (e.g., ionization, scattering) that occurred at a specific step.
- **`trackID`**: A unique identifier for a particle’s track within the event.
- **`motherID`**: The track ID of the particle that produced this particle, useful for understanding decay chains or secondary interactions.
- **`PDGcode`**: The Particle Data Group (PDG) code identifying the particle type (e.g., electron, muon, proton).

### Cosmics and Energy Deposition in TPC:
- **`InTimeCosmics`**: A flag or indicator of whether the event or particle track is associated with a cosmic ray background that coincides with the neutrino interaction timing.
- **`InTimeCosmicsTime`**: The time associated with the detected cosmic event.
- **`dEtpc`, `dEpromx`, `dEpromy`, `dEpromz`**: Energy deposition variables, potentially indicating how much energy was deposited in the TPC (Time Projection Chamber) or in specific regions within the detector, with `prom` possibly referring to a specific region or characteristic.
- **`dEspreadx`, `dEspready`, `dEspreadz`**: Likely related to the spread of energy deposition in the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` directions, indicating how widely the energy is dispersed.

### Photon and Optical Detection Variables:
- **`SimPhotonsperOpChVUV`, `SimPhotonsperOpChVIS`**: The number of simulated photons detected per optical channel in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and visible (VIS) spectra, respectively.
- **`NPhotons`**: The total number of photons generated or detected.
- **`NPhotonsPMTCo`, `NPhotonsPMTUnco`**: The number of photons detected by PMTs (Photomultiplier Tubes), potentially differentiated by whether they are coincident (Co) or uncoincident (Unco) with other signals.
- **`SimPhotonsLiteVUV`, `SimPhotonsLiteVIS`**: A more lightweight or simplified representation of the simulated photons in the VUV and VIS spectra.
- **`NPhotonsXARAPUCAVUV`, `NPhotonsXARAPUCAVIS`**: The number of photons detected by the XARAPUCA (a type of optical detector) in the VUV and VIS spectra.

### Optical Hit and Flash Variables:
- **`nophits`**: The number of optical hits detected in the event.
- **`ophit_opch`**: The optical channel where a particular optical hit was recorded.
- **`ophit_peakT`, `ophit_startT`, `ophit_riseT`**: Timing information for an optical hit, including the time of the peak signal, start time, and rise time.
- **`ophit_width`**: The width of the optical hit signal.
- **`ophit_area`**: The integrated area under the optical hit signal, related to the total detected light.
- **`ophit_amplitude`**: The peak amplitude of the optical hit signal.
- **`ophit_pe`**: The number of photoelectrons detected in an optical hit, often used as a measure of the light yield.

### Flash Variables (Clusters of Optical Hits):
- **`nopflash`**: The number of optical flashes detected in the event.
- **`flash_id`**: An identifier for each flash.
- **`flash_time`**: The time associated with the flash.
- **`flash_total_pe`**: The total number of photoelectrons detected in the flash.
- **`flash_pe_v`**: The distribution of photoelectrons across different channels for the flash.
- **`flash_tpc`**: The TPC associated with the flash, in detectors with multiple TPCs.
- **`flash_y`, `flash_yerr`**: The `Y` position of the flash and its associated uncertainty.

- **`flash_ophit_amp`, `flash_ophit_area`, `flash_ophit_width`, `flash_ophit_pe`**: Similar to the `ophit_*` variables, these describe the amplitude, area, width, and number of photoelectrons for the hits associated with the flash.
- **`flash_ophit_ch`**: The optical channels involved in the flash.
